# Description
the "TedxGPREC Official Website" is a significant project that I have developed. This website serves as the official online platform for the TEDx event at GPREC. It plays a crucial role in providing comprehensive information about the TEDx event, including details about the event , the speakers who will be presenting, the schedule, and entry ticket information. The website is designed to engage and inform visitors, creating a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. To achieve this, I utilized a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
